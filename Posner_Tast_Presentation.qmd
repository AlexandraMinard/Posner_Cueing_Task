## The Posner Task
The **Posner Task** is a psychological experiment that investigates attention and reaction times.  
- Developed by Michael Posner in 1980.  
- Participants focus on a central fixation point.  
- A **cue** appears to indicate where a stimulus (**target**) might appear.  
- The goal is to measure how cues influence attention and response speed.  

## What is a Cue?
A **cue** is a visual or auditory signal that directs attention.  
- In the Posner Task, a cue typically appears before the target.  
- Types of cues:  
  - **Valid Cue**: Correctly indicates the target's location.  
  - **Invalid Cue**: Misleads by indicating the wrong location.  
  - **Neutral Cue**: Provides no location information.  

## What is a Target?
A **target** is the stimulus that participants must detect or respond to.  
- Appears after the cue.  
- Can be a shape, letter, or symbol. 
- In this case, we used an arrow.  
- Reaction time differences between **valid** and **invalid** cues reveal how attention is directed.
